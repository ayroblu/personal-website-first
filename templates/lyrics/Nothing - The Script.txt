Am I better off dead?
Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now
Than I ever was with her

As they take me to my local
Down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying
Trying not to drag my feet

They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many I know that I'm never
Only they can see where this is gonna end
But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind, turn it all around

I now that I'm drunk but I see the worst
If she'll listen this time even though this lust
I'll dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I face to face, that she'll come to her senses
Every drunk stand by tend leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind, turn it all around

And I now that I'm drunk but I see the worst
If she'll listen this time even though this lust
I'll dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

She said nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh, I got nothing, oh, I got nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

Ohh, sometimes love's intoxicating
Ohh, you're coming down, your hands are shaking
When you realize there's no one waiting

Am I better off dead?
Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now
Then I ever was with her

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind, turn it all around

And I now that I'm drunk but I see the worst
If she'll listen this time even though this lust
I'll dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

She said nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh, I got nothing, I got nothing
I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

Oh, I got nothing
I got nothing, I got nothing, I got nothing
