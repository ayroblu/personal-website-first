Any way you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Any way you want it 

She loves to laugh 
She loves to sing 
She does everything 
She loves to move 
She loves to groove 
She loves the lovin' things 

Oooh, all night, all night 
Oh, every night 
So hold tight, hold tight 
Ooh baby, hold tight 

Oh, she said 
"Any way you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Any way you want it " 
She said, "anyway you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Any way you want it" 

I was alone 
I never knew 
what good love could do 
Ooh, then we touched 
Then we sang 
About the lovin' things 

Ooh, all night, all night 
Oh, every night so hold tight 
Hold tight 
Ooh baby, hold tight 

Oh, she said, 
"Any way you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Any way you want it" 
She said, "any way you want it 
That's the way you need it 
Any way you want it"
