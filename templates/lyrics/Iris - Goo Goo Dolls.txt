And I'd give up forever to touch you
'cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
and I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
and all I can breathe is your life
and sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

Chorus:
And I don't want the world to see me
'cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
or the moment of truth in your life
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you'd bleed just to know your alive
