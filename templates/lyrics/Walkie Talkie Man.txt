Well you’re walkin and a talkin
And a movin and a groovin
And a hippin and a hoppin
And a pickin and a boppin
Those bods are being bad
You better take a stand
You gonna wake up that thing in your hand
You’re looking all around
There is trouble to be found
Make sure when you find it you get to say it loud
Gotta code three
Need back up
Bring me
My bright pink fluro jacket

He’s fat and he don’t run too fast (well you're walkin and talkin)
But he’s faster than me ('sho my walkie talkie man)
Last night at the show we saw him (well you're walkin and talkin)
Going out on the street (go go go go)

Well you’re walkin and a talkin
And a freakin and a yellin
And a bossin and a speakin
And a lookin and a pointin
Always tell us what to do
With your high top shoes
And you wave your torch
With your black short shorts
Don’t let em get away
Don’t think they can play
Nail ‘em to the wall
Cause you really need to say
Gotta code three
Need back up
Bring me
My bright red fluro jacket

He’s fat and he don’t run too fast (well you're walkin and talkin)
But he’s faster than me ('sho my walkie talkie man)
Last night at the show we saw him (well you're walkin and talkin)
Going out on the street

Just the Drums!

He’s fat and he don’t run too fast
But he’s faster than me
Last night at the show we saw him
Going out on the street
*repeat*

He's a walkie talkie man!

*repeat verse 1 in background*

He’s fat and he don’t run too fast
But he’s faster than me
Last night at the show we saw him
Going out on the street
