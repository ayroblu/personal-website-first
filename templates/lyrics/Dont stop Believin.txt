Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers, waiting... up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Street lights... people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
Betting anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
oh the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers, waiting... up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Street lights... people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Don't stop... believin'
hold on to that feeling
Street light... people

Don't stop... believin'
hold on
Street light... people

Don't stop... believin'
hold on to that feeling
Street light... people
