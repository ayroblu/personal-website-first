Bubbly
Colbie Caillat

V1: I've been awake for a while now
you've got me feelin like a child now
cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

C: It starts in my toes
and I crinkle my nose
where ever it goes I always know
that you make me smile
please stay for a while now
just take your time
where ever you go

V2: The rain is fallin on my window pane
but we are hidin in a safer place
under covers stayin dry and warm

V3: I've been asleep for a while now
You tucked me in just like a child now
Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feelin shows
Cause you make me smile
Baby just take your time now

Where ever, where ever, where ever you go
Where ever you go, I'll always know
Cause you make me smile here, just for a while
